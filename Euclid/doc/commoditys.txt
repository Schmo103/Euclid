To add commoditys (resources, but refered to as commoditys to distinguish them from godot class resource)
to the game, add a resource of type Commodity to the array called commoditys in the GameState autoload

Commoditys will (at least for now) be referenced by their string property name

When removing commodity types, make sure the commodity is no longer referenced in the price of towers or as
the product of commodity tiles
