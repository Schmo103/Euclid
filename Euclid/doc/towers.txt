The price of the towers is stored in the price dictionary in the TowerStats resources. 
The dictionary format is:
	
	{"name-of-commodity": 2,
	"name-of-other-commodity": 3} 
	
	i.e. the commodity as a string is the key and the amount is the required quantity of the commodity as an integer

All towers are in group "tower"
The base is in group "base"
The farm is in group "farm"

When adding towers make sure to:
	Create scene
	Have scene extend Tower
	Add scene to tileset
	Create TowerStats resource
	Set TowerStats Tile Information exported variables to correct values
	Add TowerStats resource to GameState.towers array
	Make sure tower collision layer is also on tower layer (2)
